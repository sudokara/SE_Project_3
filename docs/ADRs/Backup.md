# Strategy to Backup Files

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Phoenix Auto Backup System is designed to address the critical need for automated and reliable file backup solutions. Users face various risks such as hardware failures, accidental deletions, or other unforeseen circumstances that may result in data loss. To ensure data integrity and accessibility, the system must provide a comprehensive backup solution that efficiently tracks file changes or performs periodic backups.

### Alternatives Considered:
- Store Backed-Up Files Completely: This approach involves storing complete copies of files each time a backup is performed.
- Use Differential Storage with difflib in Python: This approach involves storing only the differences (diff) between the current version of files and the previous version, utilizing the difflib library in Python to generate and apply the differences.

## Decision
In this context, we propose using the **Store Backed-Up Files Completely** approach for file backup due to the following reasons:
- **Simplicity and Ease of Implementation**: Storing complete files simplifies the implementation of the backup system. It reduces the complexity of managing and applying diffs to reconstruct files, making the system more robust and easier to maintain.

- **Support for All File Types**: Storing complete files ensures that the backup system can handle all types of files effectively. While storing diffs might be suitable for text-based files, it may not be ideal for media files or other binary formats where the differentiated version could be an overhead rather than a space-saving measure.

- **Data Integrity and Accessibility**: Storing complete files ensures data integrity and accessibility. Users can easily retrieve complete, unaltered copies of their files without the need for complex reconstruction processes. This approach aligns with the primary goal of the backup system, which is to reliably safeguard user data against loss or corruption.

- **Extensibility**: Storing complete files provides a more extensible foundation for future enhancements and features. It allows for straightforward integration with additional backup strategies or optimizations without the constraints imposed by a diff-based approach.

## Consequences
- **Space Efficiency**: Storing complete files may consume more storage space compared to storing only the differentials between file versions. However, given the decreasing cost of storage and the importance of data integrity, the trade-off is deemed acceptable for the intended functionality and user experience of the Phoenix Auto Backup System.

- **Performance**: The performance of backup operations, particularly in terms of storage and network bandwidth utilization, may be impacted by storing complete files. However, optimizations such as compression and incremental backups can mitigate these concerns to a certain extent.

- **Compatibility**: Storing complete files ensures compatibility with a wide range of backup tools and systems. It simplifies interoperability and data migration, allowing users to leverage the backup system across different platforms and environments without compatibility issues arising from diff-based storage mechanisms.
