**Status:** Proposed

**Date:** [Insert Date]

**Context:**
To enhance our data protection strategy, we are evaluating several backup solutions, including Microsoft's OneDrive, Google's Google Drive, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and local storage solutions. The selected backup system should seamlessly integrate with our operations, provide robust data protection, and offer cost-effectiveness.
